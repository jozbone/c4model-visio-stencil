# C4 Model Visio Stencil
Visio stencil with shapes for creating C4 Model diagrams.

Created two new stencil versions:
- C4model-stencil.vssx: This follows the default C4 style.
- C4model-light-blue-stencil.vssx: This is an alternate stencil color scheme based on feedback that some people find the original C4 color scheme a little hard to read.

To download, click the .vssx file of the wanted variant in the file list above, and on the next page click 'Download' button.

To install in Visio, normal place is \Documents\My Shapes\. If this doesn't work for you, please google how to install stencils for your particular version of Visio and Windows.

There is also a Visio template included (C4-template.vsdx) that will give you the default style for connectors so you don't have to drag and drop lines as a different shape. This makes creating the diagrams a lot easier and faster IMHO.
